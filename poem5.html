<br><br>
<p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Whoever you are holding me now in hand,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Without one thing all will be useless,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I give you fair warning before you attempt me further,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbspI am not what you supposed, but far different.<br><br>
<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWho is he that would become my follower?<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWho would sign himself a candidate for my affections?<br><br>
<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps destructive,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbspYou would have to give up all else, I alone would expect to be your sole and exclusive standard,<br><br>
Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives around you would have to be abandon’d,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTherefore release me now before troubling yourself any further, let go your hand from my shoulders,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Put me down and depart on your way.<br><br>
<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Or else by stealth in some wood for trial,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp Or back of a rock in the open air,<br><br>
(For in any roof’d room of a house I emerge not, nor in company,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,)<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBut just possibly with you on a high hill, first watching lest any person for miles around approach unawares,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOr possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea or some quiet island,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbspHere to put your lips upon mine I permit you,<br><br>
&nbspWith the comrade’s long-dwelling kiss or the new husband’s kiss,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor I am the new husband and I am the comrade.<br><br>
<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOr if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhere I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCarry me when you go forth over land or sea;<br><br>
&nbsp&nbspFor thus merely touching you is enough, is best,<br><br>
And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried eternally.<br><br>
<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp But these leaves conning you con at peril,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor these leaves and me you will not understand,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbspThey will elude you at first and still more afterward, I will certainly elude you,<br><br>
Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold!<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlready you see I have escaped from you.<br><br>
<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book,<br><br>
&nbsp Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNor will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very few) prove victorious,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNor will my poems do good only, they will do just as much evil, perhaps more,<br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not hit, that which I hinted at;<br><br>
<a href= "https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5b/b3/9a/5bb39a0ffbd45310f8706740dd2b8213.jpg">Therefore release me and depart on your way.</a><br><br>
