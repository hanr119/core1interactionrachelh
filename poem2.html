  <p>WHOEVER YOU ARE HOLDING ME NOW IN HAND</p>
<p>
Whoever you are holding me now in hand,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Without one thing all will be useless,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I give you fair warning before you attempt me further,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
I am not what you supposed, but far different.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<br><br><br><br><br>
Who is he that would become my follower?&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<br><br><br><br><br>
The way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps destructive,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
You would have to give up all else, I alone would expect to be your sole and exclusive standard,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
The whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives around you would have to be abandon’d,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further, let go your hand from my shoulders,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Put me down and depart on your way.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<br><br><br><br><br>
Or else by stealth in some wood for trial,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Or back of a rock in the open air,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
(For in any roof’d room of a house I emerge not, nor in company,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
And in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,)&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
But just possibly with you on a high hill, first watching lest any person for miles around approach unawares,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea or some quiet island,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
With the comrade’s long-dwelling kiss or the new husband’s kiss,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
For I am the new husband and I am the comrade.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<br><br><br><br><br>
Or if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Where I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Carry me when you go forth over land or sea;&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
For thus merely touching you is enough, is best,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried eternally.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<br><br><br><br><br>
But these leaves conning you con at peril,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
For these leaves and me you will not understand,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
They will elude you at first and still more afterward, I will certainly elude you,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold!&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Already you see I have escaped from you.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<br><br><br><br><br>
For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Nor will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very few) prove victorious,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Nor will my poems do good only, they will do just as much evil, perhaps more,&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not hit, that which I hinted at;&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
Therefore release me and depart on your way.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
