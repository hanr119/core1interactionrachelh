<a href="#WHOEVER">Whoever you are holding me now in hand,</a><br>
Without one thing all will be useless,<br>
I give you fair warning before you attempt me further,<br>
I am not what you supposed, but far different.<br>
  <br><br><br>
</uo>
<uo>
  <li> </li>
  <br><br><br>
<br>
Who is he that would become my follower?<br>
Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?<br>
  <br><br><br>
  </uo>
<uo>
  <li> </li>
  <br><br><br>
<br>
The way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps destructive,<br>
You would have to give up all else, I alone would expect to be your sole and exclusive standard,<br>
Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,<br>
The whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives around you would have to be abandon’d,<br>
Therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further, let go your hand from my shoulders,<br>
Put me down and depart on your way.<br>
  <br><br><br>
  </uo>
<uo>
  <li> </li>
  <br><br><br>
<br>
Or else by stealth in some wood for trial,<br>
Or back of a rock in the open air,<br>
(For in any roof’d room of a house I emerge not, nor in company,<br>
And in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,)<br>
But just possibly with you on a high hill, first watching lest any person for miles around approach unawares,<br>
Or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea or some quiet island,<br>
Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you,<br>
With the comrade’s long-dwelling kiss or the new husband’s kiss,<br>
For I am the new husband and I am the comrade.<br>
  <br><br><br>
  </uo>
<uo>
  <li> </li>
  <br><br><br>
<br>
Or if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,<br>
Where I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip,<br>
Carry me when you go forth over land or sea;<br>
For thus merely touching you is enough, is best,<br>
And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried eternally.<br>
  <br><br><br>
  </uo>
<uo>
  <li> </li>
  <br><br><br>
<br>
But these leaves conning you con at peril,<br>
For these leaves and me you will not understand,<br>
They will elude you at first and still more afterward, I will certainly elude you,<br>
Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold!<br>
Already you see I have escaped from you.<br>
  <br><br><br>
  </uo>
<uo>
  <li> </li>
  <br><br><br>
<br>
For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book,<br>
Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it,<br>
Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me,<br>
Nor will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very few) prove victorious,<br>
Nor will my poems do good only, they will do just as much evil, perhaps more,<br>
For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not hit, that which I hinted at;<br>
Therefore release me and depart on your way.<br>
  <br><br><br>
  </uo>
