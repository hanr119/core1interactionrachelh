  <p>WHOEVER YOU ARE HOLDING ME NOW IN HAND</p>
  <p>
<br>
Whoever you are holding me now in hand,<br>
Without one thing all will be useless,<br>
    I give you fair <a href="https://p0.piqsels.com/preview/373/527/735/red-glow-neon-macro.jpg"> &nbsp&nbsp w&nbspa&nbspr&nbspn&nbspi&nbspn&nbspg &nbsp&nbsp</a> before you attempt me further,<br>
I am not what you supposed, but&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp far &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp different.<br>

<br><br><br><br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Who is he that would become my follower?<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps destructive,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You would have to give up all else, I alone would expect to be your sole and exclusive standard,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives around you would have to be abandon’d,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further, let go your hand from my shoulders,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Put me down and depart on your way.<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Or else by stealth in some wood for trial,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Or back of a rock in the open air,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (For in any roof’d room of a house I emerge not, nor in company,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp And in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,)<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp But just possibly with you on a high hill, first watching lest any person for miles around approach unawares,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea or some quiet island,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp With the comrade’s long-dwelling kiss or the new husband’s kiss,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp For I am the new husband and I am the comrade.<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Or if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Where I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Carry me when you go forth over land or sea;<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp For thus merely touching you is enough, is best,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried eternally.<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp But these leaves conning you con at peril,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp For these leaves and me you will not understand,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp They will elude you at first and still more afterward, I will certainly elude you,<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold!<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Already you see I have escaped from you.<br>
<br><br><br><br><br>
For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book,<br>
Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it,<br>
Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me,<br>
Nor will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very few) prove victorious,<br>
Nor will my poems do good only, they will do just as much evil, perhaps more,<br>
For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not hit, that which I hinted at;<br>
Therefore release me and depart on your way.<br>
