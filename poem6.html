    <p><h1>WHOEVER YOU ARE HOLDING ME NOW IN HAND</h1></p>
<br>
  <p>
  <div>
Whoever you are holding me now in hand,<br><br>
Without one thing all will be <span><strong>useless</strong></span>,<br><br>
I give you fair warning before you attempt me further,<br><br>
I am not what you supposed, but far different.<br><br>
<br>
  </div>
  <div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
<h3>Who is he that would become my follower?<br>Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?</h3><br><br>
  </div>
  <div>
<br>
The way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps destructive,<br><br>
You would have to give up all else, I alone would expect to be your <span><strong>sole and exclusive standard</strong></span><br><br>
Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,<br><br>
The whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives around you would have to be abandon’d,<br><br>
Therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further, let go your hand from my shoulders,<br><br>
Put me down and depart on your way.<br><br>
  </div>
  <div>
<br>
Or else by stealth in some wood for trial,<br><br>
Or back of a rock in the open air,<br><br>
(For in any roof’d room of a house I emerge not, nor in company,<br><br>
And in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,)<br><br>
But just possibly with you on a high hill, first watching lest any person for miles around approach unawares,<br><br>
Or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea or some quiet island,<br><br>
Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you,<br><br>
With the comrade’s long-dwelling kiss or the new husband’s kiss,<br><br>
    For <span><strong>I am the new husband and I am the comrade</strong></span>.<br><br>
  </div>
  <div>
<br>
Or if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,<br><br>
Where I may feel the throbs of your <span><strong>heart</strong></span> rest upon your hip,<br><br>
Carry me when you go forth over land or sea;<br><br>
For thus merely touching you is enough, is best,<br><br>
And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried eternally.<br><br>
  </div>
  <div> 
<br>
But these leaves conning you con at peril,<br><br>
For these leaves and me you will not understand,<br><br>
They will elude you at first and still more afterward, I will certainly elude you,<br><br>
Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold!<br><br>
Already you see <span><strong>I have escaped from you.</strong></span><br><br>
  </div>
  <div>
<br>
For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book,<br><br>
    <span><strong>Nor</strong></span> is it by reading it you will acquire it,<br><br>
    <span><strong>Nor</strong></span> do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me,<br><br>
    <span><strong>Nor</strong></span> will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very few) prove victorious,<br><br>
    <span><strong>Nor</strong></span> will my poems do good only, they will do just as much evil, perhaps more,<br><br>
For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not hit, that which I hinted at;<br><br>
Therefore release me and depart on your way.<br><br>
</div>
